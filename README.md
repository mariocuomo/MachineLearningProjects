# Machine Learning projects
This repository is inspired by Machine Learning course at Roma Tre University.

I am developing two principale projects
- **Predicting MBTI Personality type with K-means Clustering and Gradient Boosting**<br>
The idea is to predict MBTI Personality (_Introversion/Extroversion_, _Intuition/Sensing_, _Feeling/Thinking_ and _Judging/Perceiving_) from User Generated Content - especially from post on social media.<br>
It is inspired from this [paper](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Predicting+MBTI+Personality+type+with+K-means&cvid=9ab61d1c76124f19a7e2ae7478615690&aqs=edge..69i57j69i59l2j69i60j69i64j69i61j69i60.527j0j4&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531).
- **Deep neural networks to predict diabetic retinopathy**
